# HIGH-DIMENSIONAL-DATA-CLUSTERING
Implementation of hierarchical clustering on small n-sample dataset with very high dimension


1.	Basically a good visual representation of the data with easily viewable outliers and differently trending data.  

2.	 five subgroups and how they compare to each other in a cluster of devices.  Any device that is trending differently or higher compared to others.  

3	And device clusters among like kind (device names are similar across the 5 subgroups) that display those out of the pack - outliers.
